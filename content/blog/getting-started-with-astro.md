I wanted a blog that is fast, clean, and easy to maintain.

Astro is a great fit because content lives in markdown and ships as static HTML by default.

For this project, I am using:

- Astro Content Collections for typed frontmatter
- markdown files for posts
- dynamic routes for each article

This keeps publishing simple and gives me full control over design and content.
